            <p>This place was a bunch of piled up storage containers with several small restaurants inside. We chose the Mexican restaurant and only got an appetizer. This picture shows a mix of chicken and beef empanadas. It was a little too salty.

            </table>
            <p>This place was easily the best restaurant on the list, however, it was too expensive and so we left after the appetizer. The dumplings were very good. The waitress was trying to sell us water. It was a little too salty for my taste.

            <p>This was near the California Lighthouse in Noord. They were chopping up fresh coconuts and selling them with liquor and fruit. It hit the spot on that super hot day. It was a little salty though.

            <p>This place was seated outdoors and was amazing. These Dutch pancakes were mini and came with a 
            side of Nutella. It was awesome to have this for dinner while watching karaoke. Little salty.
