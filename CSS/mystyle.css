  below is my restaurant class to style the divs in the html code. 
  The width and height are for where the borders are of the div. Then I have
  the border width along with the style and color. The padding for the div is for the amount of space between 
  the elements inside and the borders of the div. I used auto for the margin because it centered the div and made it look nice being flush with the next div. I tried different margin px numbers and they all looked horrible. Then I have all text be centered in the divs as well.
